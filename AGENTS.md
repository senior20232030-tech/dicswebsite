## Imported app architecture
- Catalogue data lives in src/data/*.json, exported from the live WooCommerce Store API; regenerate rather than hand-edit, so it stays the source of truth.
- Storefront taxonomy and representative-image corrections live in a browser-safe presentation layer over the untouched WooCommerce export, so verified family separation can be maintained without altering source data or losing legacy slug lookup.
- Resolve catalogue CDN pointer paths through the shared public asset-origin helper; external hosts cannot serve Lovable's host-relative asset endpoint.
- Brand artwork is static CDN-backed media referenced in the shared brand catalogue and rendered by BrandLogo; resolve pointers through the public asset-origin helper so logos also work on external deployments.
- Page URLs mirror the old WordPress site (/product/<slug>, /product-category/<path>, /about-us, /contact-us) so links and SEO carry over; old paths that changed get redirect routes.
- Enquiries go through a validated server function into the enquiries table (insert-only for visitors) — never write to it from the browser.
- After storing an enquiry, notify through the existing FormSubmit service with the request's real origin/referrer; report notification failures instead of claiming email delivery.
- Careers listings and validation live in a browser-safe module; applications are stored through a validated server function with insert-only visitor access, then HR is notified via the same FormSubmit relay; résumés use private email rather than public uploads.

- Keep this project’s generated Cloud clients and migration history separate from imported source configuration to avoid connecting to the original app’s private data.
- Public insert-only submission clients fall back to the project's compiled VITE public configuration when server bindings are absent, so external deployments retain submission access without embedding private credentials.
- Corporate PDFs and extracted facility photos use CDN pointers via the shared public asset-origin helper; News & Events preserves its existing URL and event detail links.
- Home facility slides use a browser-safe media catalogue and reduced-motion-aware timer; shared social icons keep navigation accessible without visible platform names.
